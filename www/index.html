    <h1>Splash Code Test</h1>
    <h2>Congratulations!</h2>
    <p>
      If you've made it this far, you've successfully set up Docker!
    </p>

    <h2>Assignment</h2>
    Your goal is to create a simple event management app. The requirements are as follows:
    <ul>
      <li>There shall be an event dashboard showing all of my events</li>
      <li>There shall be a way to add new events</li>
      <li>There shall be a way for a guest to rsvp to an event</li>
      <li>The event dashboard shall show a count of current attendees.</li>
      <li>The fields should properly handle unicode characters (in case my name is Se√±or Tacos)</li>
      <li>The event dashboard should list the event <code>title</code>, <code>start_time</code>, and <code>end_time</code></li>
      <li>If an event does not have a <code>start_time</code> it should be listed as <code>TBD</code> (To Be Determined)</li>
      <li>One should be able to easily see the event in groups of <code>Upcoming</code>, <code>Past</code>, and <code>TBD</code>.</li>
      <li>The table should be sortable by <code>Title</code>, and <code>start_time</code>, with <code>TBD</code> events taking precedence.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Feel free to use any tools or frameworks you like!</p>
